Both abilities meet their trigger condition at the same time each turn, so the Runner can choose the order in which they trigger. The second ability does not check how many credits are on Algo Trading until it resolves, so if the Runner chooses to trigger the first ability before the second ability and this brings the number of credits on it up to 6, then the second ability will be able to resolve.","False"

Since the Runner already has a position relative to the other ice protecting the server, the new ice will necessarily have a position outward from the Runner.

Can the Runner trash [Mirāju](/en/card/12071) with Hippo? If they do, are they moved to Archives?","Yes, Hippo can be used after breaking the subroutine on Mirāju, and the Runner will not be moved to Archives. Mirāju's ability checks whether the Runner broke its printed subroutine at the time they would pass it (Step 4 of the run).

If the first card the Runner accesses not in Archives that they do not steal or trash is an agenda that they host on [Film Critic](/en/card/08086), does Maw trigger?","Yes. The Runner accessed a card and did not steal or trash it. Maw's trigger condition can only ever be met after an access ends, so it isn't a condition met by entering the ""accessing a card"" timing structure. Ending the access prematurely with Film Critic won't invalidate its trigger condition.

If the Runner does not steal or trash the first card they access in HQ, and that card is then randomly selected for Maw's trigger, is the card trashed to Archives faceup or facedown?","False"

"maya","2017-05-01","","####UFAQ [Damon Stone]
Can the Runner use Maya to add an accessed card to the bottom of R&D even after trashing it or stealing it?","Yes. Maya triggers after the access has ended, so the state of the accessed card does not matter for the resolution of Maya's effect.","False"
"mayfly","2021-10-10","","Can the Runner use [Mayfly](/en/card/30032) to break more than one subroutine in a run?","Yes. Each time [Mayfly](/en/card/30032)’s interface ability resolves, it creates a delayed conditional ability that will wait until the end of the run to trash [Mayfly](/en/card/30032), but extra copies of this ability that try to resolve after [Mayfly](/en/card/30032) is already trashed will simply do nothing.","True"

"mca_informant","2017-04-12","","####UFAQ [Damon Stone]
How does ""After you resolve this operation, end your action phase."" on terminal operations like MCA Informant work?","Immediately after the operation resolves and is trashed from playing it, ""after you resolve this operation"" triggers meet their trigger condition. Ending the action phase then advances the game to the discard phase. This skips the paid ability window that would normally follow the end of an action, ceases the resolution of any other pending abilities or effects, and invalidates any conditional abilities. If the operation was played as part of a card ability, any remaining effects from that card ability immediately stop resolving as well.

If the Corp plays MCA Informant as the first operation for [Subcontract](/en/card/10113), what happens?","False"
"mca_informant","2023-01-09","","####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]

If a copy of Megaprix Qualifier in the Runner's score area has a hosted agenda counter, is it worth an extra agenda point?","No. Megaprix Qualifier's ability is only active in the Corp's score area, so it keeps its printed agenda point value in the Runner's score area.

If the Corp scores Bifrost Array while there is a copy of Megaprix Qualifier in their score area, can they trigger Megaprix Qualifier's ability and put an agenda counter on it?","False"

The choice to jack out from a run is during the approach to a piece of ice, and the restriction from jacking out on a run only applies to the first piece of ice approached during a run, not the outermost ice of any server.

Mind's Eye resolves the steps of the Timing Structure of Breaching a Server (section 11.4) as if the Runner had just made a successful run on R&D, including applying effects that modify accessing cards from R&D and setting the number of cards to access.

If the Corp is playing Mirrormorph and the third action they take on their turn is to play a Terminal operation, do they get a bonus action?","Yes. Playing an operation is not normally considered complete until step 8.6.11, after the “after you resolve” ability from the Terminal ends the action phase. If Mirrormorph were already pending at that time, it would be cancelled as per rule 5.4.3b, but it only meets its trigger condition at the next checkpoint after that (5.4.3d).

If the Runner has fewer cards in their stack than required to trash by a subroutine on Mlinzi, can they still choose to trash the top cards of the stack to not suffer the net damage?","No. The Runner must be able to pay the full cost in cards trashed in order to not suffer the net damage. (This reverses a previous ruling, which did not consider Mlinzi’s effects using the rules for costs. Since rule 1.15.1c now makes clear that trashing cards from the stack in Mlinzi’s subroutines is a cost, those rules should be applied.)","False"

The Corp, playing [Jemison Astronautics](/en/card/12016), uses Quarantine System to forfeit a [Hostile Takeover](/en/card/01094). What is the exact order of operations, and how much discount does the Corp receive for rezzing an [Asteroid Belt](/en/card/07012)?","The trigger for Jemison Astronautics is the forfeiting of the agenda. As this is a chain reaction, Jemison must resolve before Quarantine System, so the Corp places 2 advancement tokens on a card, which can be placed on Asteroid Belt. Then, Quarantine System resolves and rezzes one piece of ice at a time. If the Asteroid Belt receives the advancement tokens from Jemison, then the total rez cost of the Asteroid Belt is 1: 9 printed rez cost, 6 discounted for having 2 advancement tokens, and 2 discounted for the printed agenda point on the forfeited Hostile Takeover.

This skips the paid ability window that would normally follow the end of an action, ceases the resolution of any other pending abilities or effects, and invalidates any conditional abilities. If the operation was played as part of a card ability, any remaining effects from that card ability immediately stop resolving as well.

"virtuoso","2022-09-10","","Does the Runner’s mark stay if all mark cards leave play, or does it leave and return when a new mark card comes into play?","When you identify your mark, that server becomes your mark for the turn, even if the card that instructed you to identify your mark leaves play. If an event instructs you to identify your mark, that server continues to be your mark for the remainder of the turn after that event resolves.","True"
"virtuoso","2022-09-10","","If the Runner does not have a mark, and they install a card that says “When your turn begins, identify your mark.”, do they get a mark for the current turn?","No. The Runner only identifies a mark when an ability instructs them to.","True"
"virtuoso","2022-09-10","","If the Runner has multiple “mark” cards, how do they identify their mark?","The first time each turn the Runner resolves an instruction to identify their mark, they will randomly choose a central server. That server becomes their mark for the entire turn. Resolving another instruction to identify their mark will have no effect.","True"

"virtuoso","2022-09-10","","Does the ""otherwise"" in [Virtuoso](/en/card/33015)’s ability mean it triggers if the run is unsuccessful?","No. “Otherwise” in [Virtuoso](/en/card/33015)’s ability means “If that server is not HQ”.","True"
"virtuoso","2022-09-10","","Can the Runner over-install [Virtuoso](/en/card/33015) and trigger the “first time you make a successful run on your mark” ability a second time?","No. The next successful run on the Runner’s mark is not the first run, even if different cards are installed.","True"

What does Whistleblower do? Won’t the Runner steal the agenda anyway?","Whistleblower skips the usual sequence of steps for accessing a card, and lets the Runner steal it before any “when accessed” abilities resolve. Once the agenda is stolen, it is no longer being accessed, which stops other “when accessed” abilities from resolving. It also lets the Runner ignore additional costs to steal agendas like the one imposed by Red Herrings or the one on Obokata Protocol.

So if the Runner names Fetal AI with Whistleblower and accesses a Fetal AI, do they still suffer the net damage?","False"
